## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow
- Tailwind CSS


### What I learned 
 With this project I continued with my journey of Tailwind CSS just as the previous ones and for this one the initial setup has been going well as far as speed is concerned. I will still emphasize that Tailwind is still CSS but shorter than the normal , meaning that you will still get some problems if you didn't master or get comfortable with your CSS. With that said i am really in love with Tailwind CSS and i'm ready to continue with it till the end of time.

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development
Still as i've said previously and my last projects i will still use Tailwind CSS for long at least for now because it has so many advantages.
