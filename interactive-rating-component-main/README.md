## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- TailwindCSS

### What I learned
I have repeated this project in pure Tailwind CSS and it is no different than the other ones that i built with pure CSS but to be honest Tailwind is way faster and since we will never write markup from scratch it is great for practicing CSS concepts.




### Continued development

I still want to progress with all the projects that i have built with Tailwind CSS so that i can get handy with it.
