## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
In this project the most intimidating thing for me was the fact that I was looking for a better way to introduce multiple backgrounds in Tailwind CSS and honestly it was worst thing i have ever done. It was hectic to find a way to do this but eventually i did find a way which i will be writing about. And i general all of the multiple background capabilities in raw CSS is a little bit complicated in Tailwind for example sizing images in Tailwind is another demonðŸ˜‚ 
```html
<div class='bg-[length:500px_300px,400px_300px]'>Hello world</div><!-- for the width and height of each of the images -->
```
