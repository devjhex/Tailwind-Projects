## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned
I learnt how easy it is to use gradients in Tailwind yet previously I didn't like to even look at them because of how i fought with them in the same project when using html and CSS to build it from scratch. Fortunately, with Tailwind it wasn't what I expected to find and to make matters even worse I just realized that i forgot a color the first time I built the project.
