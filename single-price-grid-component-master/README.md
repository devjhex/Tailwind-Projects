## My process

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
Now for this project to be honest what I learned might seem obvious but I didn't see the power of padding until i started using it that much. Padding is the space between the border and the element itself. This is a game changer for me and for most of the projects I have not been using it at all since I didn't see it necessary but it is most especially in challenges like these where margin might seem  more useful.
