## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- TailwindCSS



### What I learned

I've been practicing Tailwind CSS for most of my projects and I'm actually repeating all my projects so far done with TailwindCSS so as to perfect it so good.


### Continued development

As said previously I'm repeating all my projects with Tailwind CSS so I am going to continue to use for all my projects until further notice.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/) - This helped me a lot most especially in getting to know most of the keywords to use in the html hence i highly recommend it.
