## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Tailwind CSS

### What I learned
Another project with Tailwind CSS again and to be honest there nothing much about this component but it still added some new stuff to my game most especially when it comes to tailwind CSS in particular.


### Continued development
I'm still in the process of redoing all my projects with Tailwind CSS and looking forward to completing them all.

### Useful resources

- [TailwindCSS Docs](https://www.tailwindcss.com) - This helped me alot when it comes to finding out what properties i have to apply and what keyword i have to use so i highly recommend it.
