## Overview

### The challenge
The challenge was that for all the projects that I built with CSS, I should repeat the same projects with Tailwind a CSS framework that eases the process.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
During the process of building all the projects with Tailwind, I learnt that the only difference with CSS and Tailwind is that you have shorter code to write. The point here is that you have to get your fundamentals of CSS really well to get comfortable with Tailwind, this is because tailwind is fully customizable and it will help you in most instances but in most cases when you have some complicated layouts that really get handy with CSS it will likely get handy with Tailwind but just can be done in a shorter time. So I don't take Tailwind to be a substitute but i take it to be a time saving tool that gives advantage to the Software Engineering process most likely when your Extreme Programming.

### Continued development
I will continue to  build all the future projects with Tailwind CSS because as i previously said, it is a time saver for you as the developer and it is very precise and by precise I mean ```p-4``` is more easy to write and remember that ```padding: 1rem;``` which is easy to have constant consistency around the whole project.
