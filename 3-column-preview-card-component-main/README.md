## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
This is another project with Tailwind CSS  which is great way of progress on my side. For what i have learnt so far with Tailwind CSS in particular, the setup of the project is a little bit longer than I thought but is very beneficial, I'm not sure whether it is because of the repeated times I'm having to do this or anything else but I just had to say it

### Continued development
As usual I'm ready to take my Tailwind CSS skills to the next level hence I still have some atleast 30 projects to go to switch to JS projects which i am really looking forward to.
